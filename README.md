Overview

The Etch-a-Sketch project is a simple browser-based drawing application that allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over cells. Users can customize the grid size and use different drawing modes. This project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to strengthen fundamental JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.
Features

    Dynamic Grid: Users can select the grid size for a customized drawing experience.
    Hover Drawing: Draw by hovering over cells instead of clicking.
    Clear Button: Reset the grid with a single click.
    Color Modes: Switch between different color modes:
        Default black
        Random color
        Shading (gradually darkens each hover)

Technologies Used

    HTML: For structuring the page.
    CSS: For layout and styling.
    JavaScript: To handle interactivity and logic.

How to Use

    Clear the Grid: Press the "Clear" button to reset the drawing area.

Lessons Learned

    DOM Manipulation: Used JavaScript to create and modify the grid dynamically.
